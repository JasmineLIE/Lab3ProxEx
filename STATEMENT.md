As an artist first, working with web apps and networking was difficult.  And though simple, as with my other projects, I try to make them more with art.  Moonlit Campsite promotes togetherness by reflecting data as passing things--online, there will be moments where we're never truly togeher in real time, but the mark we make exists forever and can be felt forever.  

I know Moonlit Campsite won't be popular outside of class, but that's my aim-- it's a niche web app, and whoever stumbles upon it can leave their mark--whether that be smores or star gazing--for someone else days, months, or years in the future to discover.  It's that strange exciting nature of internet data archiving I wanted to generate in web app.  

We've never alone on the internet, even if interactions span years a part.
